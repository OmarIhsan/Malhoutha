/**
 * A liquid-glass circle with an Apple-style share gesture: **tap** = [onOpen]; **press-and-hold**
 * morphs the circle into a vertical glass capsule, and **swiping up** past a threshold then releasing
 * fires [onShare] (an iOS power-slider). Idle capsule is plain glass; it tints blue as the finger
 * travels up. Fixed 52dp width; height animates 52→104. Meant to be placed as a bottom-anchored
 * overlay so the capsule grows strictly UPWARD.
 *
 * Animation notes: height and both icon layers run off a **single** [updateTransition], so the icon
 * swap can't drift away from the morph the way a separate `Crossfade` clock did. The spring is
 * deliberately well damped — the height drives *layout*, so every overshoot frame re-measures the box
 * and forces `drawBackdrop` to re-run its blur and lens at a new size. Damping here is a performance
 * fix as much as a visual one.
